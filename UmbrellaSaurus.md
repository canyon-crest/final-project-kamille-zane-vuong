UmbrellaSaurus   
Game Description:  
	Our project, UmbrellaSaurus, is a single player game where the player controls a dinosaur’s movements with their keyboard to avoid falling comets. The comets fall from the top of the screen and increase in speed as time goes on. The comets can either fall straight down or at a diagonal, and their speed increases as time goes on. The game initializes with a start screen with the title and a start button.  When pressed, this start button will take the player to the game where the dinosaur starts with three hearts representing three lives, or hits by comets. A live counter of the score is also displayed at the top left of the screen which increments every time a comet touches the ground or a power up is collected. Power ups, which look like different color candies, have a 1% chance of appearing on the ground for every frame if one is not already spawned. The pink candy represents immunity from comets for five seconds, the pink candy represents a speed boost, and the blue candy represents a comet freeze for five seconds. The dinosaur can be protected from one hit from a comet when the user presses the up arrow to activate its umbrella for a limited time. When the user has lost their last heart, they will be taken to the final screen. Here, they see “YOU LOST” alongside their current score, the leaderboard with the top 3 scores, and a “Play Again” button. For our game, a higher score is better, as it represents the amount of comets missed and power-ups collected.

How To Play:  
	The dinosaur character can be moved left or right with their respective arrow keys and can jump to get on a platform using the space key. Use the up arrow to activate the umbrella, which briefly allows the dinosaur to take a single hit from a comet. Move the dinosaur to collect power ups and avoid the falling comets to beat your last highscore\!

- Sound effect for jumping, live lost, game over, and button pressed  
- Comets fall in different directions
